# ***Tasks Database***
## *TODO*:

- 1. Create a tasks database (TO-DO type).
---
- 2. Create a notes table with columns:
    - Id - unique numeric identifier
    - Note - note text
    - DueDate - date by which it must be completed (can be blank)
    - ClosedOn - date on which the note is closed as executed (can be blank)
---
- 3. Make queries on the table:
    - 3.1. Insert at least 5 notes into the table
    - 3.2. Output all notes that contain the text "homework".
    - 3.3. Output all notes that are closed late (ClosedOn is after DueDate)
    - 3.4. Display all overdue notes (ClosedOn is blank and DueDate is before a certain (today's) date)
    - 3.5 Display all pending notes (DueDate is before a certain (tomorrow's) date or is blank and notes are not closed)
    - 3.6. Close with a specified (today's) date all notes that are not closed and contain the text "school".
